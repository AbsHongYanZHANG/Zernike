# Zernike
The RunTimeData-R28.txt and RunTimeData-R29.txt includes the test data of running time for computing the radial Zernike Polynomials for n = 28 and n = 29 with recursive and iterative schemes described in the paper entitled with "Balanced Binary Tree Schemes for Computing Zernike Radial Polynomials".
